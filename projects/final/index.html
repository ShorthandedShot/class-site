      <!-- ACTUAL INTRO -->
      <div class="dialog intro" title="Introduction">
        <p>
          When people talk about fanfiction outside of fandom circles, I feel like there is a certain association or connotation with it. Oftentimes, I find that fanfiction is seen in a humorous context — whether it be whatever people are writing on Wattpad or legitimately published novels like Fifty Shades of Grey, these stories are not always taken seriously – and sometimes for good reason. Despite that, my personal relationship with fandom and fanfiction in particular has been extremely transformative and I wanted to share some of the works, fandoms and pairings that has in one way or another become part of the person I am today.</p>

        <p>
          I can’t say for sure when my own personal history with fanfiction started. As someone who was a Tumblr kid who consumed a lot of media, there really wasn’t a lot of representation to be seen in the things I was interacting with. I got deeper into fandom and fanfiction because of the desire that I had to find parts of myself in the stuff that they enjoyed. While the source material was restrictive and had many limitations, fanfiction was a way to explore an alternate reality outside of the “canon” established by the original creators.</p>

        <p>
          As someone who was very much confused and figuring out their identity as a teenager, fanfiction offered a space for queer readers like me to see the characters I admired struggling with the same things that I were. Even if they weren’t relatable, it’s hard to put into words how important it was for me to read things that showed me that it is possible for any kind of character, hero or villain, to be queer and how that would impact the narrative. It was—and still is—so easy to default to assuming that a character is cisgender or heterosexual even when its never outright stated and fanfiction offered a space to explore the possibilities outside of that. These stories and character explorations outside of the established canon can be self-indulgent but are oftentimes handled with so much excitement and care. At the end of the day, many fanfiction authors are writing for fandom and for free.</p>

        <p>
          I have selected a small selection of fics that I’ve personally read over the years, from fandoms I have either been involved in, or from material that have been a big part of my life. To narrow down on the material, I decided to focus particularly on gay pairings from different video games. I feel like the gay half is kind of self-explanatory, with how seemingly straight a lot of male video game characters are. In terms of the focus on video games, it is both an ongoing personal interest and offers an interesting angle for exploring fanfiction. With how often video games are catered to a straight, white, male audience, there can be some really interesting explorations of masculinity and internalized homophobia when writing about the male characters in gaming, especially when they’re paired together. These stories can also get pretty explicit—especially in some of the fics I've included—though that's not necessarily the norm.</p>

        <p>
          Even if you don’t end up reading any of these, I hope that it at least gives you a new perspective on fanfiction. There's so much variety in terms of content and length, and can be a different way to engage with the things you consume. Although transformative work can be controversial—the ethics of Real Person Fiction being one example—I think that fanfiction contributes greatly to fandom culture and is an important practice for authors and audiences to explore the content the consume in more imaginative and satisfying ways. It's transformative nature is why I adore fanfiction and continue to read it now.</p>

          For a game with such a diverse cast of characters, there sure wasn’t a lot of lore accompanying Overwatch (2016), especially in the beginning. All we really knew was that there was an Omnic/robot rebellion, Overwatch is formed to deal with it, and subsequent events happen in relation to these two events that tie all of them together. As with most fan communities, ships and pairings were inevitably created. Reaper76 was one I was drawn to as they actually had some history with each other. They joined Overwatch together before an eventual rift came between them, culminating in a fight and explosion that left them both presumably dead.</p>

          <p>What drew me so much to Reaper76 was definitely the dynamic. There is so much potential for growth and character development here based on their backstories, and there’s something so satisfying about a slow burn in fiction for me. I read this fic back around 2017-2018 and at the time it was super transformative. The characterization of Jack (Soldier: 76) really resonated with me at the time as someone who was still… very much dealing with a lot of internalized homophobia. As a whole, reading something with aspects I connected with that was not treated as a joke but also a whole novel length story was definitely super important to me at the time. Considering there was like, bare minimum lore to work with I was always hoping for them both to be queer in one way or another because I was so determined to find representation in all of the content I consumed. I guess it’s fitting that Soldier: 76 was revealed to be gay later on by the Overwatch team anyways and he was never together with Reaper, but I know a small part of me will always think otherwise.

          Grand Theft Auto V (2013) is one of the best-selling video games worldwide and continues to be successful today, nearly a decade after it's inital release. Despite its popularity, there’s no denying that GTA: V is extremely problematic in its representation of women, violence, and various other topics. Recognizing all of that, I was able to still appreciate their satirical take of our world as a 14-year-old, and honestly focused a lot more on not crashing my car and over-analyzing the character dynamics.</p>

          <p>I think the thing that drew me to Michael and Trevor even though they’re both such shitty people is ultimately their narrative. The game throws you into a prologue set in North Yankton, where a heist goes horribly wrong, leaving one dead, Michael injured, and Trevor reluctantly leaving him behind to escape. Trevor is led to believe that Michael has died, Michael believes that Trevor is dead, and through the events of the games they’re reunited for one final, big heist. There’s a lot of unspoken history between the two, and that’s why examining their relationship within a romantic lens adds a huge layer of depth. </p>

          <p>This fic in particular is kind of heartbreaking and a reflection of one fucked up night between the two when they were younger before the events of the game. It’s an interesting exploration of their relationship with the same fucked up energy that’s reminiscent of the source material. This pairing has definitely been interesting in seeing how queer narratives can exist in something that’s as problematic as GTA, though obviously I should state again that I don’t condone murder or any of the other fucked up shit that happens, It’s something I definitely shouldn’t have played or read as a kid.

          Assassin's Creed (2007) was one of the first video games that I played through in its entirety on my uncle's PlayStation 3, and is part of a series that I grew to both love and hate. The first game takes place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land as the player relives the memories of Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad through his genetic ancestor using a device called the 'Animus.' It's honestly a lot to get into and the lore doesn't get any better the longer the series goes on, so that's the quickest summary I can give. Looking back, the graphics in the first game... did not age well. Thankfully there was plenty of fanart to make up for it.</p>

          <p>The story of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad and fellow assassin and eventual right-hand man, Malik Al-Sayf, is one full of tragedy and growth. Altaïr's recklessness in his youth indirectly led to the death of Malik's brother, Kadar, as well as the loss of his arm. Unable to be fully in the field as an assassin, Malik serves as the leader of the Assassin bureau in Jerusalem. Both men go through a huge period of growth in this time and there's a lot of lore I can't possibly fit here, but there is a lot to unpack in their relationship when explored through a romantic context. </p>

          <p>The savage and beautiful ring of steel kissing steel echoed off of the tall gray walls, raised from the hill by generations of Assassins past. It was a sound that they knew well, though not as well as those words that the inhabitants lived by. Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. This is the story of how a reluctant Malik gets roped into being much more than rivals with an egotistical Assassin.</p>

          <p>What makes this fic so amazing after all this time is the pure amount of care and depth that went into telling their story while also taking note of the canonical story given to players. Especially in the case of Maria Thorpe, who becomes Altaïr's wife in the game, who is addressed respectfully and not as a plot device for the men to get together (something that I've unfortunately seen happen way too often in fanfiction for gay pairings). Considering it follows the canon timeline, things don't end up entirely happy but it is still a wonderful exploration of their relationship.

          Dishonored (2012) is up there as one of my favorite video games of all time. While the setting is rather grim, the worldbuiliding, characters, and art direction brought the fictional, plague-stricken city of Dunwall to life in an exciting way. In the game, players take on the role of Corvo Attano. Formerly bodyguard to the empress, he is framed for her murder and her daughter's abduction in a plot by her Spymaster. After escaping his impending execution, Corvo is given the mark of the Outsider, a mysterious, supernatural god-like being that grants him powers to either bring upon justice or revenge based on the player's actions through his Mark, branded on Corvo's hand. </p>

          <p>Differing slightly from the other pairings included in this reader, Corvo and the Outsider definitely leans more into self-indulgent territory for me. Corvo in particular can be read as a player character, both as a silent protagonist and becuase his choices are influenced by the player's actions. Their dynamic is interesting to me because the Outsider is a god-like, supernatural figure that only gives his Mark to those he finds interesting—Corvo now being one of them. In their one-sided interactions, the Outsider gives commentary on the missions you must go through. He's seemingly neutral, but the speeches he gives after a mission will change depending on whether you choose to assassinate your targets or find an alternative, low chaos path. </p>

          <p>This fic is humorous to me in the way that it handles their relationship—it definitely helps to 'humanize' the Outsider while also giving a 'voice' to Corvo in the sense that there is spoken dialogue. Kissing the Mark is definitely one way to make it interesting, and things definitely turn explicit fast in typical fanfiction fashion.
