    <h2>Game Designer,<br>Digital Artist</h2>

    <p>Terrifying Jellyfish is a 21 year-old game designer and digital artist based in St. Louis, Missouri. He has officially released two games, Feesh and SmuggleCraft, and later this year will release NOUR, an “experimental food art game with no goals or objectives.” Here, the designer chats about the childhood fixation that lead him to making games of his own, the process by which his digital food art evolved into an actual game, and the ways in which digital creators can avoid losing their mind from working alone too much.</p>

    <h1>Conversation</h1>
    <h2>Terrifying Jellyfish on making games out of food</h2>
    <h3>From a conversation with T. Cole Rachel<br>March 6, 2018</h3>

  <!-- QUESTIONS -->
    <!-- Q#1 -->
    <p class="q"><strong><span>You’ve been making games since you were 13. Was it just sort of a natural progression for you, going from loving games to making them?</span></strong></p>

    <p>
      It did feel like a pretty natural progression. I’ve always had an interest in games. The first console I ever had was a Sega Genesis and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was the first game I played that had such a huge influence on me. To this day that game inspires the colors that I use and the vibe and enthusiasm I try to put into my work. That game was just really formative for me and I loved it so much.
    </p>

    <p>
      After playing the game for a while we discovered the debug mode cheat, which allowed you to go around the map and place things in the game. It was pretty much just a testing tool for the developers, but that really inspired me. It revealed to me an extra layer that goes on beneath the surface of the game that the average player doesn’t even know about. I think that’s what subconsciously inspired me to pursue this, even before I knew what went into games or that it was something that I could do. Because of that I was telling people, “Oh yeah, I want to be a game designer when I grow up”… but never did I think I would actually accomplish that.
    </p>

    <!-- Q#2 -->
    <p class="q"><strong><span>Do you remember the first thing that you made where you’re like, “Oh, this is actually a real thing. This is more than just a hobby or something I do for fun. This feels real.”</span></strong></p>

    <p>
      The second I got my first script working, and even more so the second I made something move on the screen—that was such a huge moment for me. To this day it still doesn’t get old. <mark>The first time you see something on the screen move because of code you’ve written is just like, “Wow.” You feel like it’s way more in your grasp than you’d ever thought possible.</mark> I remember jumping up and almost being teary I was so happy. I was just like, “Yo, I bet I can make a full game.”
    </p>

    <!-- Q#3 -->
    <p><strong>Looking at your website, it seems like your entire identity as a creator/designer is already so fully realized. Your games are all visible, you link out to your collaborators, and you have merch for sale. How did you develop your identity? Was it something you had in mind from the beginning?</strong></p>

    <p>
      Yeah. I’ve always had this visual aesthetic. I always loved designing logos for things. I love picking out color schemes. <mark>I loved graphic design even before I knew what “graphic design” was.</mark> Even back in the days when all I had was MS Paint I would sometimes draw out website layouts and stuff just because it was fun. Later on when it was time to actually create an identity for Terrifying Jellyfish I was like, “Okay, I’ll just make it as neat as possible and I’ll make it as colorful as I see it in my head. <mark>I’m just gonna make it super me.</mark>” That’s how it started. When I started the company in 2014, I was 18. I already knew what kind of stuff I liked and what I wanted it to be and what direction I wanted the brand to go in simply because I knew I wanted something that appealed perfectly to my own interests. I only worried about pleasing myself. It evolved from there.

  <!-- Q#4 -->
  <p class="q"><strong><span>What drew you specifically towards creating games as opposed to being a graphic designer or a a video artist? What is it about games that appeals to you?</span></strong></p>

  <p>
    Well, I love expressing myself in different mediums. I also do video work every now and then or I’ll do something 2D just to try something different. There’s a lot of platforms that I want to express myself in. I can never have enough creative outlets, but I always come back to games because they feel so exciting to me. I think that’s in part because of what a relatively new genre it is. <mark>With video games, I feel like there’s so many permutations of what you can do with that platform and still so little that’s been explored. So many games are just derivative of each other, so there’s still space to create something completely new and that hasn’t been seen before.</mark> A lot of indie games are going in that direction. It’s uncharted territory.
  </p>

  <!-- Q#5 -->
  <p class="q"><strong><span>You’ll soon be releasing <a style="color:white;" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/terrifyingjellyfish/nour-experimental-food-art-game-interactive-food-s?ref=card">NOUR</a>, a game you funded on Kickstarter. What was the impetus to make a game all about food?</span></strong></p>

  <p>
    It literally started with a bowl of ramen and a cup of bubble tea. I knew that there was already a culture around those kind of food items because when I’d scroll through Tumblr or Twitter I’d see endless pictures of ramen or bubble tea, these really beautiful, stylized photos. I’d see lots of food pics on all of these artsy looking blogs with these amazing colors and well-composed pictures of food. I was interested in that. I was like, “Okay, there really is a whole aesthetic surrounding food, especially ones using soft colors that kind of match and convey the flavor through the way they look.” I became interested in that concept so I first made the bubble tea just as a test to see if that was something I could do in 3D. It was literally just an art test to see if I could create a shader that simulates bubble tea.
  </p>

  <img id="pic3" src="img/tj-pic3-boba.gif" alt="an animated scene of bubble tea being splashed around">

  <p>
    So I did that and uploaded it to Twitter and the response was great. People were like, “Oh my gosh, as soon as I saw that the flavor appeared into my mouth.” I thought that was interesting, so I did the same with my ramen scene and once again the response was the same. The original tweet I made about it blew up. It was a little video I recorded of noodles falling into a bowl and then meat following it. People’s responses inspired me to make more of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    After I showed those off, a friend of mine was throwing an event and wanted me to show something at it. He was wondering if I could show my food art in some way. And I was like, “Well, I make games so what better way to do this than to try to make a game out of it.” Since it was an art show and not really a games show, I just made it to where you could press buttons to interact with the food—like buttons that popped the popcorn or whatever. <mark>That was the first iteration of the game, before I even knew it was gonna be a game. It was just playing with your food. People loved it. I found it interesting that it was a game that could fit within this art space. It was engaging enough while also not having any scores or objectives or the rules of any other traditional game.</mark>
