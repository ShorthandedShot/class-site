          <p style="font-style: italic; font-size:1.5rem;"><strong>response to <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">frank chimero - the web's grain</a> reading</strong></p>

          <p>concept: a site that starts off w/ a seemingly simple, boxed, image/object that can be dragged around and modified by a someone using their cursor. this would lead to various distortions and continually shift, never returning to its original form until the page is refreshed. </p>
          <p>this reading made me think of how templated the web currently is... i know i fall into the habit of creating these boxes and 'templates' myself before i even get the chance to determine what i am putting into my sites</p>
          <p>really enjoy the concept of edgelessness and not even thinking outside the box but just kinda.... removing the box out of the equation entirely? its definitely a good way of framing it and i definitely want to try incorporating this line of thinking moving forward</p>
