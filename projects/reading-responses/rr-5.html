          <p style="font-style: italic; font-size:1.5rem;"><strong>response to <a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools">mindy seu - the poetry of tools</a> reading</strong></p>

          <p>i liked the works under production of errors... i feel like we often associate tech + ai to "perfection" or expect them to perform without error more often than not even though like us, it's also prone to mistakes</p>
          <p>i really enjoyed damon zucconi's <a href="http://work.damonzucconi.com/debt/">debt</a> and just, the idea of a one simple message being written in so many ways due to in a way, both human (fat fingering) and machine (autocorrect) error</p>
          <p>concept: making me think about the truly useless things we can get technology to do for us... kinda want to create a site where everything you type out has a chance of being randomized in itself by either the surrounding letter keys and/or autocorrected, so it just. purposely serves no purpose and you wouldn't be able to edit it either</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;"><strong>typed out comments from original concept drawing</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>(arrow pointing to tabs in first window) autocorrect captions show here?</li>
            <li>(arrow pointing to big box in first window) where message shows up</li>
            <li>(arrow pointing to big window w "text" in it in second window) no backspacing</li>
            <li>typing S for example, would lead to the surrounding letters? (arrows pointing to w, a, d and x keys)</li>
            <li>word options based on these key combos will pop up</li>
            <li>you can only create a message using these "auto corrected" created words</li>
          </ul>
