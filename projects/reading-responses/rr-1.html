    <img style="height: 60%;" src="img/rr1.jpg" alt="scan of reading response with small sketches depicting website concept of a room">

    <p>kind of a blend of things from 'a handmade web' and 'my website is a shifting house' ... thinking about the circular story by j.r. carpenter and the idea by schwulst of a website as a room. </p>

    <p>concept: a site that is an infinite loop of rooms that have elements that can be shifted and moved around.</p>

    <p>while objects in the room all stay the same, depending on the room positions may be randomized</p>

    <p>clicking on either door will take you to the next room.</p>
